# TRLLM-Traffic-Rules-Assistant

项目LOGO由DALL·E生成:
- Prompt:
> I want a logo for a github project called Traffic-Rules-Assistant. 
>
> I want it to look minimal and tech-based. It should be clear enough to be legible in a small profile avatar. Please make the logo fit within a circle. The border of the circular logo represents the steering wheel, and the interior of the circular logo draws a robot to represent the large language model (There should be more emphasis on the features of the steering wheel, and the robot can just be represented figuratively with sketch lines). Use the colors black and variations of blue for the circular logo, and the background color should be clean white.
>
> The main logo should just contain the letters: "TRLLM".  "TRLLM" needs to be directly below the circular logo!!! Both the circular LOGO and the "TRLLM" text should be centered in the vertical direction (y-axis direction).
